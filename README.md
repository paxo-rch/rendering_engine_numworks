# rendering_engine_numworks
simple python 3d engine for numworks calculator, requires upsilon os (not epsilon).
You can move in all directions in 3D but you cannot interact!
The map is in a file relatively easy to understand
I specify that the rendering time is very slow (for several tens of blocks, it will take several seconds per frame)
